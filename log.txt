What to do for identifying the notes?

current idea:
threshold the brightness, and run a connected component analysis
problem:
we get two connected components per note
could filter out by size, though that doesn't make it resolution agnostic
solution:
rather than identify the bright spots, identify the colours used HSV
we can get the connected component by masking out based on the note's HSV colour
this is typically a range, so look at dark and brinht spots in paint to find something appropriate
then, we can filter out all the small squares

for red detection, we need to wrap the hue around 0, eg detect between 0-5, 355-360
